*****************
* short summary *
*****************

P1: this participant makes a configuration (obfs3, no proxy), but since bootstrapping took too long, was convinced it was wrong. Then tried "connecting directly" by pressing connect on the first screen, which worked. But the participant was convinced that they made a direct connection. 

P2: participant chose the connect directly button out of intimidation of technical words associated with configuration, and this worked for the environment they were in. 

P3: this participant configured a bridge successfully (obfs3, the default), even though they didn't need to. They didn't know the difference between censored websites and censored internet connections. 

P4: after successful configuration, the participant is convinced that the file explorer on windows IS the Tor browser for a long time, before figuring out what the browser is. 

P5: watch this participant create an email account on the fly and use the auto responder to use a custom bridge to connect successfully. 

P6: after 26 minutes, this participant actually tries multiple bridges, never trying a proxy, to connect against a censor which blocks tor relays and hardcoded bridge IPs.

P7: when the vanilla tor connection didn't work, this participant chose obfs3 (default bridge) and no proxy as the "next path of least resistance," which worked against a censor who only blocked publicly listed tor relays. 

P8: we had a clock drift, which made the task of connecting impossible for this participant. It's not to see what they do in frustration, and how the error messages don't help much with this case. 

P9: this participant reads the text on the screen thoroughly, and decides to connect directly, which works against a censor which only blocks websites. one try! 

P10: this participant configured a bridge successfully (obfs3, the default), even when they didn't need to. This is the second instance where this has happened because participants don't know the difference between website and internet connection censorship (@P3). 

P11: this participant tries to connect using vanilla tor by clicking connect, which doesn't work against a censor that blocks public Tor relays. Then they try to connect using vanilla tor because they answered that they didn't need or a proxy, which also didn't work. They try connecting with a bridge (obfs3, default) and no proxy, which works. 
 
P12: this participant managed to connect using vanilla tor in an environment where tor public relays were censored, because a new relay which we weren't blocking came online in between the morning and this experiment. But note that they just kept trying to connect directly until it worked, not trying other things. 

P13: chooses the correct configuration but never tries it, with some confusion of proxies being the culprit. The participant succeeds in configuring a bridge (obfs3, default) after 5 restarts of Tor. 

P14: watch this poor user try the same configuration 7 times(?!!) and fail and guess proxy settings.  27 minutes, later, we cut them off. Because they are convinced they need a proxy, they failed to connect because they never bother to pick a different bridge (chose obfs3, required meek or custom).
  
P15: watch this poor user struggle for 21 minutes because they are convinced they need a proxy, and fail because they never bother to pick a different bridge (chose obfs3, required meek or custom). 

P16: a technical mystery causes a successful Tor connection using a blocked bridge, but then the browser stops working and the participant is forced to reconfigure. They never succeed. 

**************************
* Grouped by environment *
**************************

We placed participants in three levels of censorship requirements, with E1 being the least restrictive and E3 being the most restrictive. E1 is a censor which only blocks websites, so a vanilla Tor connection or any correct configuration will work. E2 is a censor which blocks websites and all publicly listed Tor relays, so any correct configuration will work, but vanilla Tor connections will not. E3 is a censor which blocks websites, all public Tor relays, and all hardcoded bridge addresses. Participants in E3 are required to choose one of the meek bridges or get a custom bridge without the use of bribes.torproject.org (which was also blocked). 

E1: P2, P3, P4, P9, P10
E2: P7, P8, P11, P12, P13
E3: P1, P5, P6, P14, P15, P16

**********************************
* Grouped by technical expertise * 
**********************************

We screened our participants specifically for knowledge of Tor, in addition to other demographic considerations. Generally, the people who have used Tor have the highest level of expertise, people who have heard of Tor are pretty technically savvy, and we specifically recruited people who were not in computer science and has never heard of Tor or used it before for the majority of our participants. 

has never heard of Tor or used it: P2, P3, P4, P12, P13, P14, P15, P16
heard of tor but has not used it:  P1, P6, P7, P9, P13
used tor before: P8, P10, P11, P5

* Play-by-play of events *
**************************

P1 (heard of tor before): E3 (~8:30) 

Participants tries to connect directly, and waits for a while, but quits waiting after the progress bar stops, after a minute or so. Then they configured but said no and no to both questions (which is the direct connection, again). The progress bar doesn’t show. Tries obfs3 and no proxy (check to see that there is no proxy required). Progress bar gets further (10%), but stalls. Gets bored and quits. Tries meek-azure, clicked connect, and it makes progress. It was slow, so didn’t realize it was going to connect and didn’t bother to wait. Stops waiting, and is convinced that it didn’t work, and checks proxy settings again. Tries “connect” on the first page again, thinking that a direct connection is being made again, but meek-azure was being used. Participant was not aware that the connection was made with a bridge. 

P2(regular): E1 (~1:52) 

Participant reads the first window for a while. Participant clicks connect, and the connection succeeds. Participant said that they tried the connect option because they were intimidated by the thought of configuration, so they tried the direct connection method first. The participant spends the rest of the video being a bit confused about the tasks which were required of them, which just tests that they were able to circumvent censorship. 

P3(regular): E1 (N/A; lost chunk of video… but ~1 minute) 

Participant first tries out the first task (going to cnn) without circumventing censorship, just to test if the website is blocked or not. It is not, so the participant is able to complete the task and spends some time reading the page. The participant tries to download Tor Browser online. Participant realizes that there is VLC, and accidentally cuts off our recording. But realizes that there is Tor Browser on the desktop, and begins the configuration process. We are missing video data on the bridge configuration, and we see the participant on the proxy configuration screen. Participant decided to try connecting without a proxy to see if it would work, and the connection succeeds. We believe that the participant used the obfs3 bridge, because the connection process took a while and the pages were slow to load (normal connections would be faster, and obfs3 was being slow that day). Note that the participant did not need to configure a bridge, but did so anyway. 

P4(regular): E1 (~4:30)

Participant uses a key shortcut on internet explorer to open a inprivate browser. Participant first tries out the first task (going to cnn) without circumventing censorship, just to test if the website is blocked or not. It is not, so the participant is is able to complete the task. Participant tries to go to wikipedia, but is unable to do so. Participant googles for how to set up Tor browser in internet explorer, maybe unaware that Tor is on the desktop. The participant sees the Tor browser icon on the desktop, and when the configuration window pops up, the participant does not see the window and assumes that the file explorer is the Tor launcher window. Participant maximizes the file explorer window and assumes it is the browser. You can’t blame the participant! The top of the file explorer says “Tor Browser,” and the search bar says “Search Tor Browser.” Participant remains confused for a while, trying to go to wikipedia in the file search bar, and finds an .xml file with the name wikipedia and opens that file (oh boy..). Tries to search for wikipedia in file system and still does not know that she is in file explorer. Participant closes the file explorer and sees the Tor configuration window, and doesn’t realize how it got there. 

Clicks configure out of curiosity, and decides to configure bridges. Chooses the recommended bridge, and looks at the proxy options, also out of curiosity. Participant does not know what to put in the fields, and goes all the way back to the bridges. Changes to obfs4 without actually trying obfs3. Believed that seeing the proxy question was a failure state, and that obfs3 didn’t work. Chooses to connect without a proxy, not realizing that this is why they are able to make a connection (in their mind, they had tried obfs3 and it didn’t work, but in reality they never tried obfs3) . The connection succeeds. Note that the participant did not need to configure a bridge, but did so anyway. 

P5 (has used tor before): E3 (~22:30)

Participant tries to connect directly to the Tor network, and the connection fails. The progress bar gets to 80%, which is odd (probably an error with our firewall). The participant then figures that there is configuration necessary, and clicks configure. Participant says to both questions which determine if they need a bridge or a proxy, and makes another direct connection because of the answers to both questions. The connection fails. Participant goes back and tries the default PT (obfs3) with no proxy, which also does not work. This time, there is no error message, and the progress bar just stays empty. Participant waits for a while, and decided that it failed. Participant now tries to look up the proxy settings to see if they need a proxy to connect. Gives up, and tries to look at cnn, to see if that works. They do. They try wikipedia. It doesn’t work. Participant clicks Copy Tor Log to Clipboard, and looks at the error messages. Changes the PT to scramblesuit, doesn’t use a proxy, and tries to connect again. The progress bar shows that the connection is almost there (80%), but it is stuck there and eventually uses the time to go to check proxy settings. Decides that the PT is not working and chooses meek-google. Participant looks at the progress bar, which look like 0% (because it will not update until it gets past 80%) got impatient and cancels the connection (even though this configuration would have worked!). Participant looks at the log again, and uses the messages to debug. Tries meek-google again, waits a bit but gets impatient again and cancels the connection again. Participant decides that they do not need a bridge now, and tries to connect without a bridge and without a proxy. They get an unhelpful error message, so they decide to google for the error message, but they don’t really find anything useful. Participant tries the direct connection (no, no) again. Decides that they do need a bridge after all, and tries obfs3, and uses the waiting time to browse the web. Closes down the configuration process. Opens it again, yes to bridges, clicks help. Participant tries to uses the bridges.torproject.org, but it is blocked (we blocked it). Then the participant makes a fake email account on the fly so that they can use it for the auto responder. They try rise up, which didn’t work. In parallel, they try meek-amazon with no proxy (which should work!), but the connection times out instead. They try yahoo, but they have trouble with filling in fake information it accepts. In parallel, tries PT scramblesuit with no proxy, and waits for a while, but gives up. Is able to create a fake account on google. Tries to follow the instructions and emails the autoresponder. Sends a messages with get bridges in the subject, but fails since it needs to be in the body. Clicked reply to the help email, and this is in the body now, but fails since there is the help information quoted in the body. Tries again with a fresh email with “get bridges” in the body. Types in the bridges into the custom bridges BY HAND (omg), and is able to connect with custom bridge and no proxy. OGMVP. 

P6 (heard of Tor): E3 (~26:50) 

Participant opens the launcher, drags it to the middle, clicks configure because they know that they are being censored. They say no to bridges and no to the proxy, and makes a direct connection. The progress bar stalls at 5%, the participant gets bored of waiting, and eventually cancels the connection. Opens up settings on chrome to see if they needs a proxy. Gives up and goes back and tries obfs3 with no proxy, progress bar stalls at 10%, and participant eventually gets bored and quits the connection. Participant decides that they need a proxy, but gets intimidated and goes all the way back to the beginning. Decides that they need a bridge, tries obfs3 again, looks at proxy settings in firefox to see if they need a proxy, gives up, tries to connect with obfs3 and no proxy again, and it doesn’t work, participants waits a while, and cancels the connection. Tries obfs3 FOR THE THIRD TIME with no proxy. Participant searches “does my network block tor,” but couldn’t read the articles because we blocked Tor. Participant searches “how long does it take to connect to Tor.” No helpful links. Particpant searches “Establishing an encrypted directory connection” (what the progress bar says). Not much helpful links. Gives up, goes back and uses flashproxy no proxy (blip in our recording makes it look instantaneous), and it doesn’t work. Progress bar is at zero and participant tries to kill time, and eventually cancels the connection. Participant then tries obfs4 no proxy, which also doesn’t work. Participant cancels, goes back to help, didn’t read, tries scramblesuit no proxy, which doesn’t work. Now participant is looking for proxy settings to see if participant needs a proxy. Decided that stye do not need a proxy, and tries scramblesuit no proxy again, which doesn’t work. Participant googles for local proxy settings in chrome. Tries obfs3 no proxy again in parallel. Participant looks for proxy settings for a while, but doesn’t really find much. Participant has no idea why this isn’t working and gets no feedback. Participant cancels the obfs3 no proxy connection and goes back and tries a direct connection (no, no), which gives you more progress bar than choosing a PT, which is really misleading. Goes back to the original screen and connects directly again, which doesn’t work. Goes through the configuration dialogue, answers no, no, and tries a direct connection a third time. Goes back, picks meek-google no proxy, and finally succeeds. 

P7 (heard of Tor): E2 (~4:30) 

Participant clicks connect, and waits about three minutes, but the progress bar isn’t moving and gives up. Participant clicks configure, clicks obfs3 no proxy, and the connection works. Participant said that they tried connect just to see if it worked, and when it didn’t, went with the path of least resistance for configuration, which worked. 

P8 (used Tor): E2 (clock drift mission impossible, never succeeds) 

Participant had no chance of succeeding. Our VM had a clock drift, so there were errors. Participant tries to go to cnn to complete the first task. Participant first tries a direct connection. Then goes through the configuration dialogue to say no and no. Restarts tor browser, tries obfs3 no proxy. This should have worked, but there was the clock sync error. Participant then looks up for help, tries to go to bridges.torproject.org, which is blocked. goes back, tries obfs3, looks at proxy stuff, but immediately backtracks out of intimidation. Goes back and decides that they need a proxy, and starts to look at proxy settings in chrome. Finds information in LAN settings, and follows the instructions, filling in a blank address and port 80 for proxy settings, but that doesn’t work. Participant tries to then guess protocols, but doesn’t work. Restarts tor again, and clicks connect, which actually uses obfs3 no proxy, but this doesn’t succeed (it should) because of the clock error. They really look at the internet properties for a looooooong time. Tries to add wikipedia.com, then wikipeda.org to the trusted sites, and tries to then go to wikipedia.  Tries to go to wikipedia again in a fresh chrome instance, which doesn’t work, and then goes for help and checks proxies again. Gives up. Goes to bridges.torproject.org, which is blocked. Tries meek-amazon but doesn’t work. Looks in firefox for proxy settings. Tries localhost as a bridge because they see that information from firefox (which says “no proxy for: localhost, 127.0.0.1”), which triggers an error. Tries meek google, then mozilla help settings for proxy, and decides to not use a proxy, so meek-google with no proxy, which should work, also fails. Decides to go back and click connect (also meek-google no proxy), whig doesn’t work. Final desperate attempts lead user to look all over the computer: control panel, remote connection, etc. Tries flashproxy no proxy, cancels connection when it makes no connection. Tries fte no proxy, fte-ipv6 no proxy, obfs3 non proxy.. tries them all down the line. Goes back to the beginning and clicks connect, tries scramblesuit no proxy, struggles on the proxy window, tries obfs3 again, looks at help again… Poor guy. Decides to just traverse windows out of frustration… and never tries anything again. We cut him off. 

P9 (regular): E1 (~0:45)

Particpant goes to cnn in chrome to see if the website is blocked. It is not, and participant is able to complete the first task. Participant googles for the wikipedia featured article, and sees that the website is blocked. Participant opens up Tor, reads all the text on the screen, and clicks connect, which works!

P10 (has used Tor before): E1

Participant clicks configure, chooses configure, goes with obfs3 because it is recommended, no proxy, and connects successfully on the first try. Note that the participant did not need to configure a bridge but did. They were confused on 1st (blocking websites) and 2nd level (blocking censorship circumvention technologies) censorship. 

P11 (used Tor before): E2 (~3:00)

Participant moves the dialogue to the middle of the screen, and reads the first screen thoroughly. Tries connecting directly, which doesn’t work. Goes through the configuration dialogue, and chooses no bridge no proxy, which also doesn’t work. Goes back and looks at the options, but chooses to connect with the default options—obfs3 no proxy, and the connection works. 

P12 (regular): E2

Participant clicks configure on the first screen, and answers no, no, making a direct connection. The direct connection (shouldn’t work) doesn’t seem to make progress, and cancels the connection. Participant look at the proxy settings, backs out, almost looks for proxy settings, but tries the connection again (no, no). While waiting for the connection, the participant decides to look at the proxy settings. While they are looking for proxy settings, the connection times out in error. Participant continues to look at proxy settings for a long time. Tries the no bridge and no proxy connection again, and it WORKS the third time! WTF. What had happened was that Tor was running in the background as a dameoin and was bootstrapping—and between the time we made our firewall rules and this participant was run, there was a new public relay which came online, and once the bootstrapping process completed, that new relay was used to get online. Tor launcher hid the fact that the bootstrapping progress was completed until the participant clicked connect again. Note that the participant never thought to look back into bridge configuration because all the errors were popping up right around the proxy configuration windows. 

P13 (regular): E2

Participant clicks connect, which does not work. Configures, decides on a bridge, chooses obfs3 because it was recommended, looks at proxy, goes back, and kills the process. Starts tor again, tries connecting connecting directly again, and gets an error, failed. Says no to bridges and no to proxy, and tries to connect directly again, which also does not work. The progress bar shows no progress and after waiting a while, the participant cancels the connection. The participant tries to connect with the same settings again and gets an error right away. Participant looks for proxy settings in firefox, tries to configure an HTTP proxy. Goes to firefox help for advanced proxy settings. Killed instance of Tor again, started up a new instance again, and clicked connect directly again (but it is only direct because it uses previous settings and the previous settings were to not use a bridge or proxy), which does’t work. They click configure, and clicked the next button to say no to bridges and (video blip) yes to proxy. Participant restarts Tor one more time (this is the fifth time!) and chooses configure, obfs3 with no proxy, which works. Note that the participant never tried connecting with obfs3, because they assumed that reaching the proxy screen meant that they did not configure the bridge correctly. 

P14 (regular): E3 FAIL

The participant starts by attempting a direct connection to the tor network, which does not work since we blocked Tor's public relays and hard coded relays in this environment. The participant decides to configure the browser after the connection doesn't work, and chooses obfs3 as the bridge and looks at the proxy settings, but attempts to connect without a proxy. There is some progress shown on the progress bar, but eventually, the participant sees that this connection will not succeed and exits the progress bar, exits the configuration window and starts again. The participant re-tries a direct connection to the Tor network, which does not work. The participant decides to configure, and chooses the same options as last time (obfs3, no proxy). When this doesn't work, the participant decides to configure a proxy, but doesn't know what to do and looks for the internet settings in firefox. The participant tries a bunch of different proxy types in the configuration from the drop down menu (but doesn't attempt to connect), and continues to look for internet settings in firefox. The participant copies the Tor log to the clipboard, restarts Tor browser and configures again. Again, the participant tries the same configuration (obfs3 and no proxy), which doesn't work. The participant looks at the different bridge options, but decides to try a custom bridge by typing in "tor" into the bridge relay box, which triggers an error. The participant clicks on the help button, and tries bridges.torproject.org, but we have also blocked that in our experiment. The participant chooses the obfs bridge, and tries to configure the proxy again, this time by looking at their own ip address, which is incorrect for configuring the proxy. They copy their own IP into the proxy, and try to make a connection, which does not work, since the connection to the Tor network just requires a non-hardcoded bridge (or a meek bridge). The participant tries to connect this time, without a bridge and with their ill-configured proxy, which also does not work. They exit out of tor browser and start tor browser again, choosing to try a connection again with obfs3. But they look for more internet settings since they think they need a correct proxy configuration. The try connecting with a obfs3 and no proxy again (?!) which doesn't work. They go back to proxy settings and try to configure the proxy some more. They try connecting with a different type of proxy (socks5 rather than HTTP) but this doesn't work either. They go back all the way to the beginning of the configuration dialogue and try a direct connection, which also doesn't work. They go back to the configuration menu, and this time, the participant is reading everything thoroughly (even using the mouse to read the words). They unfortunately choose obfs3 as their bridge again, and  try connecting with their ill-configured proxy again (again!!). After 27 minutes of effort, we interrupt the participant. The participant never succeeds in configuring. 

P15 (regular): E3 FAIL 

The participant does not realize that Tor is installed on the desktop and looks for tor online by searching in internet explorer.  Participant clicks on an unrelated link in the search which leads them to some code and explores internet security settings in internet explorer. The participant tries to visit torproject.org, but finds it blocked again. The participant tries to diagnose the problem in internet explorer and looks int he settings some more. The participant exits out of internet explorer and tries to visit tor project again, which doesn't work. The participant then tries to use firefox to look for tor, but ends up on blackhatworld.com and looks for an internet ip addresses. after 5 minutes, the participant realizes the browser is installed and clicks on the browser. The participant decides to configure the browser, and says that their internet connection is censored. They choose the obfs3 PT, and on the next screen, decide that they don't need a proxy. This connection doesn't succeed in this environment where the tor public relays and hardcoded relays are blocked. The participant realizes the connection isn't working, looks back at the bridge configuration, but decides obfs3 is fine, but that a proxy is required. They look at the proxy settings, decide that they don't need a proxy after all, and try the same connection again (which didn't work last time). The participant hits cancel and also tries to connect again, with the same configurations. Again, it does not work. This time, the participants waits patiently for a while, exploring the computer, looking at chrome settings, internet explorer internet options, parental controls on the computer, and looks up an internet speed test to check that the internet is working. The participant yahoo searches for "need local proxy to access internet" on firefox, then "how to unblock tor." The participant reads about bridge relays, bridges.torproject.org, and bridges@torproject.org. The participant then googles for "vidalia," which directs them to a wikipedia article, which is blocked because we blocked wikipedia. Participant then searches for "how to unblock vidalia," but then exits firefox and tor (presumably in frustration). The participant goes through the configuration again, but chooses the same bridge, even though what they really need is a different bridge. The participant gets to the proxy screen and beings searching for "how to see internet settings in firefox" on firefox. The participant discovers that cnn is unblocked, and goes to cnn in firefox to answer one of our questions. The participant tries to configure Tor one more time, but chooses the same bridge a third time and gets stuck on the proxy screen again. We interrupt them after they have been trying for 21 minutes. The participant never succeeds. 

P16: E3 FAIL (why did obfs3 work the first time? It shouldn't have!)

connect, doesn't work, configure + no, no, doesn't work. Tries to look at settings in multiple browsers, firefox then chrome, to check the proxy settings. Gives up and goes back and tries connecting with a bridge and no proxy, choosing obfs3 (the recommended one). The connection succeeds. The obfs3 relay is really slow or something, because the participant is frustrated and starts to check settings all around the browser while waiting for the website to load. The participant gives up, exits out of Tor, and uses chrome to access cnn, the unblocked website on our list of tasks. The participant is unable to go to wikipedia on chrome since it is blocked, so the participant tries to visit it on firefox. The participant goes back to Tor a second time. The user clicks on the "open settings" button since a warning pops up on the button. This time, the connection (same configuration with an obfs3) does not work. The participant goes through the configuration dialog again, but chooses the same connection (obfs3 with no proxy). This connection doesn't work, so the participant looks at the proxy settings, but gives up and tries using internet explorer to go to wikipedia, and uses diagnostic tools and troubleshooting reports on internet explorer. Note that the participant never succeeded in configuring the browser correctly. Even when the participant accidentally got Tor Browser to pop up, the participant was convinced it was not working.
