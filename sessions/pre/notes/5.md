Subject 5 (environment 3)
=========================

Notes from NM
-------------

### Can you talk us through what you did and your thought process?
at first, I opened the tor browser and accepted the default option
I waited a little bit and then it failed, in 30 seconds or so

after that failed, I went to this option to configure the bridge or proxy settings
and I said yes here
I used the recommended bridge type
waited for a few minutes
it felt like a long time
it made no progress, the progress bar

remembered asked about proxy settings
checked Chrome for them

canceled that
tried scramblesuit
showed a bit more progress
waited a few mintues again

tried to look at the log
couldn't find anything useful

resource limit error message
googled it
found something about capacity

tried meek-google, meek-amazon, flashproxy

after all of those, found help button
tried bridges.torproject.org but connection refused
tried riseup.net, couldn't request account
tried signing up for fake yahoo account, problems because of mobile number

censorshipusability
wsxd1234

put get bridges in subject
realized it needed to be in body
didn't work because of quoted content
new message

### What was the most challenging part of connecting?
when trying automated bridges, and it showed me no indication of progress, and I didn't know if I was supposed to cancel and try a different option, or if they weren't working at all

### What is one change you would recommend?
make it more obvious if the bridges are not working
empty progress bar with no message
so I just canceled it because I was getting impatien

I thought it was kind of dumb that the email address didn't accept the commands in the subject, or with the quotes

### How did you decide which options to choose?
I tried the pluggable transport that used google, because I noticed that google was working
scramblusuit because heard them in the office
selected the ones I heard about
otherwise, relatively random

### Was there anything unexpected that happened?
expected automated proxy methods to work, but didn't
didn't realize to click the help process until much later
could highlight that if the other methods don't work

### What did you think about using Tor? / What did you think of the experience as a whole?
this was pretty frustrating
I was about to give up until I noticed the help button

### Was anything confusing about the tasks we gave you?

riseup didn't work first, but then started working


### more
thought meek-google didn't work, got thrown off, because the progress bar didn't update (was stuck at 0) until a new log message appeared, so it wasn't making progress
"totally unclear if you need to wait 1 minute, 5 minutes, 1 hour"
