=========================

Notes from NM
-------------

### Can you talk us through what you did and your thought process?
kept on entering a captcha, so I thought, this is a trap

the second option was confusing
I was about to do configure
then I thought configure means to change manual settings
let's take the risk and if it doesn't happen, I can configure
the second options is misleading
I came here to get censored data
if it said for manual settings, choose configure, it would've been simpler for me

too much information on new tab page, so I skipped it and entered google.com

### What was the most challenging part of connecting?
to figure out how to actually open the site
figuring out how to reach site

thought first screen was misleading because I didn't know [which to press]

### What is one change you would recommend?
to circumvent press connect, to do manual settings press configure, it would've made my life easier

we lame users get everywhere through google
would've been helpful for it to say do your search from here, instead of going to do google

### How did you decide which options to choose?
(see above) configure seemed manual

### Was there anything unexpected that happened?
### What did you think about using Tor? / What did you think of the experience as a whole?
why is it so slow?

### Was anything confusing about the tasks we gave you?
the instructions were so clear on the paper
if you're facing censorship, use tor
