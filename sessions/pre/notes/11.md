Notes from NM
-------------

### Can you talk us through what you did and your thought process?

I didn't know first if my ISP is also blocking connections to Tor
that's why I tried the easy method before
I was a little bit scared about having to configure bridges
but then there were preconfigured bridges, so that was fine
but I was wondering where they came from? did you set them up?

### What was the most challenging part of connecting?
at the first screen, you could select if you wanted to connect to the network directly or use a bridge
but when I selected a bridge there was an option to connect to the tor network directly again
which was confusing because I already selected I wanted to use bridges

### What is one change you would recommend?
I didn't get why they put the local proxy settings [on the first screen]
I know what a local proxy is, but I can imagine a lot of people don't know what that is
putting those two on the one path, I don't see the reason behind that

[screen 2]
this question is really unnecessary because I just selected that I have a censored connection, why do they ask me again?
and then they even say that no is the preferred choice,
which makes no choice because I just selected I wanted to select bridges

[proxy]
I think you can only answer this question correctly if you know what a local proxy is
otherwise you have no chance
because looking at the internet setting in another browser, that could be anything

### How did you decide which options to choose?
I just [used] the default
because I didn't know where the settings were coming from
it was the first choice, tried it if it works
there was no explanation for what those settings mean

### Was there anything unexpected that happened?
surprised it didn't ask me about my privacy needs
I would have to go by myself to the settings to set that up

### What did you think about using Tor? / What did you think of the experience as a whole?
I'm an expert user, so I would prefer more freedom in the configuration
I know what I'm doing,
so I don't have to the problem to ask me and lead me in circles
for example for the privacy settings, you could only slide from high to low, it didn't really explain what it means technically
there was no button explaining what it's doing
that would be helpful I think
it's a pretty good product for an open-source product, for a free product

### Was anything confusing about the tasks we gave you?
it wasn't clear to me if my task was to circumvent censorship or be anonymous
there are two use cases for tor
they are both somewhat integrated
at the setup it didn't ask me anything about my privacy needs
I would have to configure that in the browser plugin settings
that's kind of dangerous I think
because I saw that the initial privacy settings are pretty low

### Other suggestions
why not autoprobing?
well then, the first question should be do you have privacy needs, or are you just trying to circumvent censorship?
