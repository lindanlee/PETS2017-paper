The config dialog for people under mild censorship is not optimal.
(Optimized for heavier censorship.)
People don't understand diff. between 1st-order censorship and 2nd-order censorship.

Everyone in the mild censorship environment wanted to configure,
thought they needed bridges, thought they needed proxies.
We thought it would be okay to see the proxy window (no harm done)
but people got there and then were frightened away from it ("Back").

The first wizard page is more confusing than we thought.
A lot of trouble stems from that.
A lot of people ended up on the proxy settings
(people seem confused by terms etc. and are doing things they don't have to).
People aren't making informed choices;
either don't read or don't understand.

One though that when they chose a bridge,
that it didn't work because they also chose to use a proxy
and got a confusing interface.
Went back and chose obfs4, this time chose *not* to use a proxy,
and attributed the change to obfs4 vs. obfs3 rather than
the true cause, no proxy vs. proxy.

We thought we should give them more information,
like the fact that Tor is on the desktop and they don't have to download it.
But the failure cases are interesting;
e.g. Googling to download Tor Browser and finding torproject.org blocked.
Maybe give guidance when we do the quantitative Xlab study,
but not during these qualitative studies.

People seem to be affected by the time limit (we gave them 20 minutes).
Let's not mention a time limit, and just come in 20 minuts from the
end of the session if they're not done.
