In relation to bridges and proxies:

###  How did you decide which options to choose?

- clicked option to connect directly
- even though the other option mentioned censorship, figured it would work anyway

### Was there anything unexpected that happened?

- most unexpected was seeing configuration dialog: thought a navigator window would pop up like in other browsers

### You encountered a pop-up warning. Do you remember what it said? Why did you decide to choose the option you did?

- something about this computer saving it
- chose default
- kind of like the save-your-password dialog
- always clicks never

### What did you think of the experience as a whole?

- thought something else was going to pop up

### Was anything confusing about the tasks we gave you?
