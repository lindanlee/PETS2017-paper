Notes from NM
-------------

### Can you talk us through what you did and your thought process?
"this will work in most situations" so I just went with connect first
I figured I have to configure it
[obfs3] was recommended, so I went with this
to get around [proxies], I pressed no and got the same result again

asked him to go to browsers and check if they have proxies, so looked for those

have nothing to fill in, don't know where to find IP or port for proxy

email option "sounds interesting"
"that would've been my next step"

### What was the most challenging part of connecting?
figuring out the semantics of the bridge
what does each bridge mean to me?
I have no clue what's the difference between flashproxy, ft, â€¦

[after told about email]
I need to know why the built-in ones aren't working
letting the user know why you need custom bridges
why the provided, default bridges aren't working

why do I need a custom bridge, if there are options built in
what is the copy log button? have to do with custom bridges?
it's the biggest icon on a screen
if it takes so much time to start a browser up, is it worth it?

### What is one change you would recommend?
I want not a tutorial, but a skippable instruction page
something like Tor for dummies
assuming that the user knows nothing
making them start from scratch
at least I will know how Tor works
in which case will "connect directly" work?
if I'm using Tor, I will want to know about how it works

pictorial instead of text
screenshots
I would not read that
it would be much better if I could see the actual screen
if it's just words, I have to go back to the words

"did not find the text helpful enough"
when do I go into the censored category?

### How did you decide which options to choose?
went for ones that were more "relatable": amazon, google
tried to add random, custom bridges to it

### Was there anything unexpected that happened?
custom bridges:
I'm assuming the IP address is for the actual PC [the machine I'm using]

proxy:
autofill would be a good option

### What did you think about using Tor? / What did you think of the experience as a whole?
obviously it's not as personable as [Firefox or Chrome]
looks more mechanical than the other interfaces
round the edges, metaphorically

### Was anything confusing about the tasks we gave you?
