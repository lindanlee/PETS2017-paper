Notes from NM
-------------

### Can you talk us through what you did and your thought process?
when I get in these deals on the internet, I keep clicking and tinkering
just trying to follow different pats
it was talking about the settings on the browsers that would tell you if there was a proxy or something
I don't now if I was looking in the wrong place or something

connect or configure? I did both

[bridges]
because I've never configured a proxy or worked with that stuff
at this point, I was just going to keep clicking and pray

talking to my nephew, he uses proxies all the time
since tor is set up for people like me, there must be some way they'll walk me through it

### What was the most challenging part of connecting?
there doesn't seem to be any timeout on any of this stuff
am I waiting long enough
should I wait 5 minutes
it should it work immediately
it was driving enough
cnn came up, so maybe it was a five minute delay


### What is one change you would recommend?
put in a 30 second timeout
I don't know, maybe it takes longer than that


maybe a little help thing to tell you where to go to find the proxy settings

adequate explanations?
if I was in that situation, I would need to learn the terms

best way to learn?
online tutorial where you're actively clicking through and learning the pathways

where would you go for help in real life?
my nephew or some technical person

heard about anything before?
Tor, vaguely, heard about it.
probably reading news articles or something, censored stuff, anonymous surfing

### How did you decide which options to choose?
### Was there anything unexpected that happened?
didn't think the configure option would be so technical, thought there would be a simple path or something

### What did you think about using Tor? / What did you think of the experience as a whole?
surprised I was able to get to the cnn thing, did it by random monkey clicking
frustrating that I couldn't get to wikipedia
figured there must be something I'm missing

### Was anything confusing about the tasks we gave you?
cursor blinking driving me nuts
