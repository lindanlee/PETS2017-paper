"we have Tor Browser here on the desktop for you" "oh, duh"

cut off after reaching CNN homepage

### Can you talk us through what you did and your thought process?
I think I went configure
because you said it was censored

I put yes
you told me that they probably censored Tor

I thought I better use their bridges, because I haven't even heard of it,
and they probably know, because it's recommended

[proxy]
that was confusing. I went to every browser and could not find what they were talking about
I googled how I would find that and couldn't seem to get good information
couldn't find anything that said tools
picture of a wrench, maybe developer tools

I backtracked a few times
I thought maybe if I got my IP address, maybe I can find out what's going on with this IP
If I'm getting spam, I'll look the IP on Yahoo, it'll show where it's coming from

I was starting to think toward the end, maybe I'll choose one of the others, maybe it'll work better

### What was the most challenging part of connecting?
You get [progress bar] and completely hit the wall
sitting looking at that for quite a while, it didn't go any further
unfortunately I quit and then it wouldn't start at all

### Unfamiliar terms?
proxies, I kinda sorta know something about that
internet settings, it looked easy, but I just could not find that

### What is one change you would recommend?
It was pretty frustrating
give it to a couple of people who know how to do this
they can feel elite
believe that about themselves to wake up in the morning
they only want the elite to use some computer things

"just start from scratch, it's horrible"
software developers are paid to make it user-friendly, you click on something and it works
it just stalls

### How did you decide which options to choose?
### Was there anything unexpected that happened?
my experience with Tor is that you can't connect to it, so I was not surprised

### What did you think about using Tor? / What did you think of the experience as a whole?
I've actually tried to put Tor on public computers, and it didn't work
the minute you try to put tor on that, it doesn't work, you need to be an administrator
I have a problem with this stalker

### Was anything confusing about the tasks we gave you?

### Any information you needed?
I didn't know if this computer had any proxy information, and I wasn't able to find out if it did.
