Subject 10 (environment 1)
==========================

Notes from NM
-------------

### Can you talk us through what you did and your thought process?
[screen 1]
I didn't quite remember if I was...
I was censored, so from that, the second one

[screen 2]
here, I wasn't sure
it wasn't clear from task description that the network was blocked, maybe just sites that were blocked
figured if that was blocked, didn't want me accessing network, so said yes

I didn't know any bridge myself, so I figured I'd let it use the default

local proxy, I know, would be if I was in a company or in a coffee shop
while tor was loading, tried another browser, saw page loaded, so didn't need proxy

### What was the most challenging part of connecting?
the second dialog
I know I'm censored from news
I'm assuming they would censor the tor network, as well as the information

### What is one change you would recommend?
I would like a nice little graph
you're almost there

in the second dialog, "if some sites are blocked, they're likely censoring the network itself"
some description here of the level of censorship you're experiencing might help clarify


### How did you decide which options to choose?
I didn't even look [at other options]
could see that it was recommended, default option

### Was there anything unexpected that happened?
### What did you think about using Tor? / What did you think of the experience as a whole?
pretty straightforward

### Was anything confusing about the tasks we gave you?
