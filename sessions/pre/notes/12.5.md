didn't realize wikipedia is blocked
and then I couldn't figure out the port thing
and I realized the port thing
you have to stop it and then start it if I changed thing
[thought connected via vidalia, went online with tor browser]

after that I couldn't find the browser


hardest
I didn't know what I was doing, I was just guessing
figured out how to install it and get it running

is it possible to default to have a ton of open ports
most people, if they're oppressed they're not going to know what a port is
they're not gonna know what half those words mean
just having more targeted audience, not someone who knows what any of those words mean

is there a way to have to to default
even the reasons it's not working to someone who doesn't know cs, they don't know what the are
[settings, in vidalia]
"simply enter the correct port numbers"
and I was like really guys?

thought after it connected, I thought you could just go to the browser


it was kind of amusing, but I think it's because I wasn't in an oppressed setting
I hope I would never need it
