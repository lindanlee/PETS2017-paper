Notes from NM
-------------

### Can you talk us through what you did and your thought process?
I had no idea what I was doing

my thought process always is I go with the thing that's highlighted

I was just like, whoa, what's going on
I don't know what a set of bridges is , or where I would obtain in
so I just picked and recommended and pressed next

I remember on my phone when I went to China
I found my local proxy on the phone, but couldn't find it here

went to "Wikipedia" [wikihow]

[first page]
default "this makes sense"
but bridges/proxies don't

### What was the most challenging part of connecting?
just generally had no idea what I was doing
I've used VPNs before, and I was just given two numbers to set up.

### What is one change you would recommend?
have, when it pops up, instructions
I don't know any of these things, what it means
when I pressed connect, I think before I did something wrong
I was on that page for, like, ages

it said to look for internet settings
couldn't find internet settings
didn't know where to find them

### How did you decide which options to choose?
### Was there anything unexpected that happened?
"the interface works really well"
it all led me to places I thought

### What did you think about using Tor? / What did you think of the experience as a whole?
the buttons all made sense, but the wording
I feel like if I understood computers
I really don't know what configure means in this setting
hmm, is it going to crash?
when you see connect, you really want it to connect

### Was anything confusing about the tasks we gave you?

### Do you have any ideas about what went wrong?
I found the IP address
I don't know what proxy is, really
I didn't know where to find it
"lost from step 1"
"I'm really bad with computer anyway"
