Notes from NM
-------------

### Can you talk us through what you did and your thought process?

- I was, like, what am I doing?
- let me read the directions
- google tor browser
- realize it's on the desktop

- let me start the tor browser
- and that was pretty easy
- not really sure about the proxy question
- so let me say yes
- didn't understand
- asked to enter some numbers -> no
- go back and let me try

[upon noticing international CNN has different headlines]

- ooh, it makes sense
- oh my god this is amazing
- someone controlling the internet wants me to see [different things]
- no censorship with Tor!


### What was the most challenging part of connecting?

- the vocabulary, for someone not doing IT work
- you hear proxy and you're like great, what is that?
- good thing I'm really curious
- being able to use trial and error
- clicking back and changing answers

- noted the connection was slow when got to the website

- I feel like Mission Impossible
- you're a little badass

###  What is one change you would recommend?

less options

- understand that the options are specific to what you're working on
- as someone who doesn't know all of these aspects
- the more simple you can make it, the easier it is
- that's why a lot of people use apple and ipad products
- it's simplicity
- sense of boom, I click a button and I'm there

###  How did you decide which options to choose?

- first screen:
    - know dealing with censorship
    - keyword censored
    - chose configure
    - otherwise probably would've chosen the first one
    - because it's Tor
- with proxies, trial and error
    - could try to figure it out
    - and plug things in
    - not a PC user
    - if were using a mac, would've tried to figure out proxies
    - was unfamiliar, so went back

### Was there anything unexpected that happened?

- surprised that the output of CNN was different

- just thinking of censorship earlier
- radio censored the word booty, but had song about cocaine (I'm in love with coco)
- we should let people decide what they see

### What did you think about using Tor? / What did you think of the experience as a whole?

- seemed pretty easy
- like any other browser
- uses Safari at home
- differences between browser didn't make an impact

### Was anything confusing about the tasks we gave you?

- got confused until reread directions
- even in confusion, it was exciting
