Notes from NM
-------------

### Can you talk us through what you did and your thought process?
tried direct connect because "it will work in most situations"
the progress bar wasn't moving
so thought, okay, this might not be working
canceled and clicked on configure
"yes" because thought the websites were being blocked
I didn't know what this was, so I went with the default
for this one, I decided it was no, because I don't know the local proxy configuration
it it doesn't, could go back and change it

### What was the most challenging part of connecting?
the bridge screen
didn't know what this was
seemed very technical to me
do you know what a bridge is? "no"
since it said recommended, it helped actually
since it was also selected, chose it
I saw custom bridges, I didn't know what to enter here
so I thought let me go with this

proxy:
I didn't know the computer's settings
I thought the default no
let me go with what's selected

### What is one change you would recommend?

second screen: clear and helpful
the comment below was helpful
but: did not notice bridge definition: "only read the first part"
not here for security, here for something else; put in minimum effort
"minimum effort seems to be [reading] one line"

I don't know what these [bridges] all are

proxies: is there a way to do this automatically?

a small video where you go through the whole thing
explaining what each selection means
at the beginning or when you got stuck? "preferably at the beginning, but I would also like to access it if I got stuck"
would you watch the whole video? "I wouldn't like to read, I would like to see something happen"
it's funny how my mind works
I would've read the whole thing if I wasn't sure how to answer the question
maybe if the comment were included on the bridge screen, I would've read it

### How did you decide which options to choose?
### Was there anything unexpected that happened?
unexpected part the connection was slow
really, really slow
I expected some kind of delay, but this seems to be very slow
I'm from India, in India that's the speed at which we get Internet

### What did you think about using Tor? / What did you think of the experience as a whole?
Tor was somewhat similar to Chrome
found it familiar

### Was anything confusing about the tasks we gave you?
confused about where to find the featured article
suggests providing the URL
