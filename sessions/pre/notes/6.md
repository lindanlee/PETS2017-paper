Notes from NM
-------------

### Can you talk us through what you did and your thought process?
"this…unbelievable"

I was pretty confident that things were censored because of Wikipeda
I was pretty confident about it being yes
it had this one already picked
I was pretty confident that [proxy] was no, but I checked Chrome, then Firefox, then IE
then I tried connecting, but it would get stuck
how long does it take? this is ridiculous?
I remember trying obfs4, search for things
after a while, I started doubting things
I remember I went all the way back and tried [direct connect]
at one point, I tried flash
and I was, like, please, just do it
I finally tried meek-google and it worked, and I don't know why
I started thinking it would be one thing
as I got more frustrated, I just [clicked things]
it was frustrating

### What was the most challenging part of connecting?
what was annoying:
progress bar had no feedback for me
I didn't know why I was getting back
establishing encrypted directory - what does that mean for me?
how long does this actually take?
I was waiting, this is way too long
this didn't help me, and I also didn't know how long it should take
you should probably reevaluate this part of the connection


### What is one change you would recommend?
something actionable on the waiting dialog
the dropdown was blocking
explaining what each of the bridges meant
googled transport names
which is probably not the safest thing
I would probably have googled [which transport to pick] next

### How did you decide which options to choose?
obfs3 then obfs4
scramblesuit next on the list
flashproxy name looked familiar
meek-google at random

### Was there anything unexpected that happened?
deceptively easily
the whole configuring was annoying
compared to chrome, you open it, and it works
surprising how little information there was
when I searched for things, a lot of them were torproject, which I can't reach
they have so much space in there

### What did you think about using Tor? / What did you think of the experience as a whole?
"frustrating"
the browsing experience was fine: "I reached the promised land"
the setup was so annoying, I didn't even look at the browser

### Was anything confusing about the tasks we gave you?
why was CNN blocked?

…

"that was not fun"
