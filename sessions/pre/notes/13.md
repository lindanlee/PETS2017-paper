Notes from NM
-------------

### Can you talk us through what you did and your thought process?
I was kind of doubting myself because everything was really slow

was just fiddling, to be honest with you
I was trying to figure out how all the pieces fit together

"it was kind of confusing"
I didn't know where to start
I didn't know what to do
where would I look for all the right answers
under settings, what would I look for


### What was the most challenging part of connecting?
I wasn't sure what you meant by looking at Internet settings
### What is one change you would recommend?
I would say, use this first, because it's the first option
there's too much text
maybe something like, try me first
either you guys automatically configure it for me
or you give me step by step pictures
which browser are you using? okay, firefox, click on your browser
you need to copy and paste

### How did you decide which options to choose?
I don't remember what I did.
I figured it out? What? [laughs]
I don't actually know what I did!
oh, man, that's crazy. okay, cool.

### Was there anything unexpected that happened?
honestly, I have no idea what I did

### What did you think about using Tor? / What did you think of the experience as a whole?
I was a little frustrated
I'm better with images
if you had more images in step 1, it would be easier
it's cool

### Was anything confusing about the tasks we gave you?
