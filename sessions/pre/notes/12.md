Note: broke through with repeated direct connect attempts, likely due to new relay coming online

Notes from NM
-------------

"so, Tor Browser is what I'm in right now?" "no, that's Firefox"

### Can you talk us through what you did and your thought process?
[first screen]
the whole purpose of your study is to get around censorship, so that's why I picked the second one

for this question, I wasn't super sure how to answer it
and it said if you're not sure choose no, so I chose no

probably embarrassing, not super sure what a local proxy is
tried to go through internet explorer to figure out what the local proxy
was going back and forth about whether I needed to put no or yes on this one

the first time I did it, I wasn't sure if I did something in between there or something
it took kind of a long time to connect, and I wasn't sure if it was an Airbears thing

### What was the most challenging part of connecting?
it would be a little bit easier if I knew what a local proxy was
but that may just be a me thing
that was the one thing I feel like I kinda got stuck on

### What is one change you would recommend?
struggled most with local proxy
I don't know how you would walk someone through that
more along the lines of click this and you'll know
for me personally I would like to go read about this

### How did you decide which options to choose?
"process of elimination, trial and error"

### Was there anything unexpected that happened?
my lack of knowledge of computers did not surprise me
I thought it was really really really cool that you cold set up a whole browser do set up a browser to circumvent censorship issues

### What did you think about using Tor? / What did you think of the experience as a whole?
good sign that trial and error approach worked
it looks like I could've contacted [email] for help

### Was anything confusing about the tasks we gave you?
