Notes from NM
-------------

### What was most challenging?

figuring out if the progress bar wasn't moving because the connection was censored, of if it was just slow

### Why did you pick the bridges you did?

- first picked the recommended one
- then picked meek-azure because heard David mention it in meetings
- if hadn't heard of any bridges, would Google them (rather than picking one that sounded familiar)

### What could be improved?

- was confused because the second screen seems to duplicates choice from the first one
    - explained that the instructions addressed this, but they didn't read the pages carefully
- thought they didn't end up using a bridge because they canceled and went to main menu
    - actually Tor reused the settings from the last attempt

### Action items

- purpose: test tor browser
- make it clear that it may be censored
    - might have to set it up correctly
- there may be N correct answers
- policy: no assist/feedback, cut off after 25 minutes
