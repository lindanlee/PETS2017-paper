Subject 1 (environment 3)
=========================

Notes from LL
-------------

### Chain of events: 
* Participant spent a lot of time navigating windows, and trying multiple bridges (obfs3, meek-azure) before succeeding. 
* Participant ended up configuring the meek-azure bridge, didn't believe that the bridge was working, and then "connected to the Tor network directly," but the interface saves your settings when you click the connect button, so actually connected with meek-azure.
* Participant thought that meek-azure worked the second time around because it was faster. The concensus needs to be downloaded upon the first connection, which takes a long time. While waiting the first time, the concensus was partially downloaded, and when tried again, the progress bar filled up faster and ended up looking like it was working.
* If participant had restarted the prompt, then the connect action on the first window would have connected to vanilla Tor. Hmm...  

### Observations: 
* Participant first tried connecting to the Tor network directly. Maybe telling them that "websites and services" are blocked isn't enough to make them realize that the Tor Browser may be blocked. 
* Participant didn't read the text in the interface. In interview, participant said the text was clear and addressed what she was wondering about, but she did not read it. Perhaps there is too much text. 
* Participant could not tell if something was not working, or if something was taking a long time. There isn't much feedback in the interface. 
* Participant picked the recommended bridge, then one participant had heard of before (meek-azure, from a tech talk). If participant had not hear of any, would try randomly or look up transports on google to see what they were. Familiar sounding names "scrambesuit" vs "obfs4" would not have swayed decisions on which would get picked first. 
* Participant was able to check the proxy settings on firefox and chrome and realize that they did not need a proxy to connect. 
*Participant did not realize how they had finally connected to the Tor network!

Strictest censorship environment.

Notes from NM

### What was most challenging?

figuring out if the progress bar wasn't moving because the connection was censored, of if it was just slow

### Why did you pick the bridges you did?

- first picked the recommended one
- then picked meek-azure because heard David mention it in meetings
- if hadn't heard of any bridges, would Google them (rather than picking one that sounded familiar)

### What could be improved?

- was confused because the second screen seems to duplicates choice from the first one
    - explained that the instructions addressed this, but they didn't read the pages carefully
- thought they didn't end up using a bridge because they canceled and went to main menu
    - actually Tor reused the settings from the last attempt

### Action items

- purpose: test tor browser
- make it clear that it may be censored
    - might have to set it up correctly
- policy: no assist/feedback, cut off after 25 minutes


Notes from DF
-------------

Tried "Connect", bootstrapped 5%, stopped waiting.
Checked Firefox proxy settings.
Tried obfs3, bootstrapped 10%, stopped waiting.
Tried meek-azure, bootstrapped 20%, stopped waiting.
Checked Chrome proxy settings.
Waited some more for meek-azure, made slow progress, finally finished.

What was the hardest part? Not knowing whether the progress bar was stuck because it was censored or because it was just slow.
First chose obfs3 because it was recommended; decided it was not working because of a lack of progress in the progress bar.
Tried meek-azure because the name was familiar.
Transport was not meaningful; probably would have Googled to find out what they were.
When clicking "Connect" at the end, thought it was using vanilla Tor, did not realize that it was using cached meek-azure settings.
