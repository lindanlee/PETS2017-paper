Strictest censorship environment.

Notes from NM
-------------

### What was most challenging?

figuring out if the progress bar wasn't moving because the connection was censored, of if it was just slow

### Why did you pick the bridges you did?

- first picked the recommended one
- then picked meek-azure because heard David mention it in meetings
- if hadn't heard of any bridges, would Google them (rather than picking one that sounded familiar)

### What could be improved?

- was confused because the second screen seems to duplicates choice from the first one
    - explained that the instructions addressed this, but they didn't read the pages carefully
- thought they didn't end up using a bridge because they canceled and went to main menu
    - actually Tor reused the settings from the last attempt

### Action items

- purpose: test tor browser
- make it clear that it may be censored
    - might have to set it up correctly
- there may be N correct answers
- policy: no assist/feedback, cut off after 25 minutes


Notes from DF
-------------

Tried "Connect", bootstrapped 5%, stopped waiting.
Checked Firefox proxy settings.
Tried obfs3, bootstrapped 10%, stopped waiting.
Tried meek-azure, bootstrapped 20%, stopped waiting.
Checked Chrome proxy settings.
Waited some more for meek-azure, made slow progress, finally finished.

What was the hardest part? Not knowing whether the progress bar was stuck because it was censored or because it was just slow.
First chose obfs3 because it was recommended; decided it was not working because of a lack of progress in the progress bar.
Tried meek-azure because the name was familiar.
Transport was not meaningful; probably would have Googled to find out what they were.
When clicking "Connect" at the end, thought it was using vanilla Tor, did not realize that it was using cached meek-azure settings.
