Notes from NM
-------------

### Can you talk us through what you did and your thought process?

- accustomed to using private browsing
- thought I'd try that
- that did not work for either one
- oh no, it did
- it worked for CNN
- that surprised me a little bit

- then I thought, what is this tor browser anyway
- then I noticed there was a tor browser already mounted
- I think I clicked on that browser
- I've never once looked at tor
- I was clicking around [the Windows file explorer]
- there was nothing that correlated with the instructions
- then I thought, dang, ohh

- there was something that I did, and I didn't even know what I did [to open the Tor configuration dialog]
- it gave me some choices
- I followed the instructions on the sheet
- then it didn't work
- I chose the recommended setting [obfs3]
- I was going to logically step through each of those
- it's not that I have brilliant insight, but I'm persistent
- you have to document what you did
- I just thought, okay, I'll try obfs4

### What was the most challenging part of connecting?

- confused to see that the browser was already there
- thinking too hard
- wouldn't be in real world

- got a little frustrated with the tabs
- alright, you little sucka
- I'm very nerdy
- I like to understand how it's constructed
- if this then that
- I was at a cul de sac, not dead end

- I knew it was censored or proxied, that was the whole point
- does it block, that's true
- I looked at custom bridges and said, no, I need more information
- [then chose obfs3]
- I started overthinking
- the idea was that you need a remote proxy
- said yes: "just trying things"
- got to this point, I don't have an IP address
- know HTTP is normal web portal handle
- SOCKS is a special protocol
- alright, I'm sort of stuck
- thought, what brought me to this point; it was local proxy
- went all the way back to obfs3
- this is the point where I would've gone through and tried methodically
- the 3 was already there
- why would you have a non-working there, that's..shitty
- I think I changed it to say no, I didn't need it

- felt most insecure when got stuck, needed IP address
- thought maybe socks
- could've gone online
- but competitive, wanted to get through quickly

- if someone's not technical, they would get tired and give up
- if there were ways somehow...
- it's so subjective
- when I saw 3, the next logically for me was 4
- others may not reason that way
- older people more likely to give up

###  What is one change you would recommend?

- put descriptions of choices in much more of a standard,
- lay person's language
- instead of local proxy, say: do you need to put some distance between yourself and the party imposing censorship
- understand tying to get the hell away from whoever's restricting

bridges:

- could put a hint
- put them in order of likelihood of what you want
- because that's natural for people to do that
- put a little clarification
- a little decoding of what those are

- try not to make it frustrating or problematic
- people feel over their heads
- would need a more powerful motivation
- normal people would give up pretty quickly
- it's so oriented towards engineers
- engineers are just in their own world


###  How did you decide which options to choose?
### You encountered a pop-up warning. Do you remember what it said? Why did you decide to choose the option you did?

[thought] there were none!

### Was there anything unexpected that happened?

nothing was surprising or unexpected

### What did you think about using Tor? / What did you think of the experience as a whole?

- I was intrigued
- it's good to have a utility like this
- though of course the bad guys are using it too

- might give myself an assignment to sit down and explore or understand them
- so if you encountered someone who wanted to use it
- could give them a primer
- have friends in China, Romania, Israel, who sometimes ask her for advice


### Was anything confusing about the tasks we gave you?

- told the mission
- but didn't give any tools or guidance
- very, very minimal

- and I do know what an IP address is
- but I know you need access to the administrator function
- decided to go back

- if I was czar, I would impose much more draconian requirements about security
- I worked at Cisco
- they don't give a shit about security
- they really don't care in a general sense
- just want get the product out, and be the first one
- they're trying to get mindshare percent
- unless it's imposed
- because it's time and money
- if I could be the czar, I would impose a restriction
- that they couldn't just put it out there
- and not care about all the bugs, loopholes, mistakes
- that are allowing this
- there was brew-haha about NSA and Snowden
- all these people using the free products, don't they understand
- their data is getting sold, exploited
- at least the NSA is doing it to protect country and way of life
- everyone's upset about it
- but shit, what about Google
- as opposed to Facebook who says bend over, we're not adding lubricant

- worried about bad guys using it
- they are using it to bring about the end of the world
