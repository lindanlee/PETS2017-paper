Tor Circumvention UX Experiment: 
-2 settings: where tor and websites are blocked, where tor is not blocked but websites are blocked. 
-follow up with one-on-one interviews for outliers and random participants 
-implement an improvement

Scope: 
- Tor’s configuration dialogue only, with respect to censorship circumvention
! Not in scope: proxies, user trust models, rest of Tor’s UX, anonymity

Data collected: 
-configuration control flow: via video capture
-participants information/feedback: via survey
! Let’s not write extensions or log everything

Analyses: 
- show a markov chain version of the configuration tree, before and after changes
- measure dangerous mistakes, mistakes, time to completion, paths taken, etc. 
- analyze the behaviors of people after-the-fact to see how many would have made a dangerous mistake (observe actions, then see what would have happened in other censorship environments—i.e. they would have not been able to search online for “tor config help,” they would have been blocked and logged that they tried to go to a website so the police will come, etc.)
- qualitative analysis on survey answers
