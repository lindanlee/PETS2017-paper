                         ===== Paper summary =====

The paper describes two studies, one qualitative and one quantitative,
on the usability of setting of Tor in different circumvention
environments. The authors find that understanding the circumvention
environment and matching that to the right setting can be very
challenging to users, and this is particularly difficult given some of
the technical terminology embedded within the Tor browser. The authors
propose to correct some of these issue via recommendations to improve
the accessibility/usability design of the Tor browser connection setup
system.

                      ===== Comments for author =====

-- META REVIEW --


After a broad discussion, we find this paper to be focusing on an interesting topic and have well motivated goals. However, there are three major issues that we wish to be addressed in a major revision. We hope that the authors can make theses changes and resubmit to PETS.

1. Expansion of the Related Work and Contextualizing Results with prior work from HCI and Usable Security: The reviewers feel that there is not sufficient coverage of usable security and HCI research in the related work and how that prior work is integrated into the design/research process. In particular, please see Review B's notes. Also see Review D’s suggestions to cite relevant prior work on Tor. Furthermore, it is important to situate the findings from this work within that existing literature; adding more related work in the introduction is not sufficient. How does this work fit within existing work? How does it challenge it? Bolster it?

2. Elaborate Design Process and Qualitative Contributions: The reviewers find the connection between the qualitative experiments to the quantitative ones unclear at times as how one informed the other. This includes providing a pluralistic walkthrough, defining the scope of the work, further graphical depictions of the final design process, connecting the design process better with the qualitative feedback.

3. Improve Overall Presentation: As mentioned by all reviewers, the authors should generally improving improve the quality of the presentation. Specifically, Reviewer C recommends reorganizing the paper, including moving some information from the appendices to the paper itself. Reviewer C also recommends such a reorganization, especially including relevant statistical tests in the paper rather than in the appendix.

=========================================

-- INDIVIDUAL REVIEW --



Overall, I liked this paper and think it is a perfect fit for PETs. I
want to start with two main shortcomings I noticed in the paper so
that the authors can respond in their rebuttal.

(1) This paper does a good job motivating the issues with using Tor
for mostly novice users. I use the word "novice" not to imply
technically illiterate, but novice in using Tor. I agree with the
findings, overall, but I think the it would be important for the
authors to point out that they are studying individuals who are likely
have no need or desire to use Tor in the circumvention enviornments
that they describe. As such, they may not be super familiar with what
is happening, regardless of their technical literacy, and thus, less
aware of the setup services. It would be very interesting to run this
study again with users who live within these environment and may have
some passing idea of how to properly address different circumvention
settings.

(2) The other issue I have is something more of a statistical
one. when comparing the success rates differences between the two
settings, e.g., 68% to 50% for E3, may not be strongly meaningful
different across all the sets. Maybe I missed it, but I didn't see a
stat test for this (perhaps because it wasn't meaningful). However,
clearly, the median time to success is quite different. I think it
would be important to emphasize that these updated instructions would
improve the setup time speed, it may not fully address the issues of
establishing the setup in the first place. I still think this is a
worthwhile result, but it something I'd like to see this a bit more
emphasized as a limitation.

Other than those two major issues, I think the paper offers a lot of
interesting insight and tangible feedback for improving the Tor
browsing experience.

                         ===== Paper summary =====

This paper presents one qualitative and one quantitative usability studies for Tor’s censorship circumvention functions configurations. It draws conclusions and recommendations for improving the usability.

                      ===== Comments for author =====

Strength of the paper:
-------------------------------
The topic of the paper is very relevant, as Tor’s launcher GUI is using rather technical terms and  concepts that are most likely unknown to most lay users (or even to users with some technical background). Even though some of the detected usability problems are not surprising, it is valuable to have usability studies providing more scientific  and providinig some useful recommendations.
Also, I agree that the presented simulated censorhip environments can be useful fort future testing of censorship circumvention software, as the authors conclude.
The paper is well written (except for some minor language mistakes) and easy to follow.
The studies were well planned and some detected usability issues could be addressed by a second improved ad tested GUI version.


Weaknesses of the paper:
------------------------------------
The recommended improvements seem to be ad hoc and not based on previously researched or tested usability heuristics or research finidings.  Even though the recommendations sound reasonable and helpful, some of them (and possibly others) could be derived from general usability heuristics such as by Nielsen, "10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design" (see: https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/). For instance, your recommendation "Help users recognize, diagnose and recover from errors" can be derived from Nielsen's heuritic: "Error messages need to be clear and suggest a solution".
The authors may also want to have a look at or to refer to Johnston, J., Jan HP Eloff, and Les Labuschagne. "Security and human computer interfaces." Computers & Security 22.8 (2003): 675-684, because this paper provides another example how Nielsen's usability heurtistics were matched to IT security usability recommendations (however, in that case for the area of firewalls).

There is also more related usable privacy/secuity literature, e.g. on how to design IT security warnings (e.g. by Egelman et al., http://repository.cmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1061&context=hcii) that may be useful to refer to for backing up recommendations or deriving more detailed ones.

It should be motivated in the paper why a qualitative test was followed by the quantitative study for the improved GUI (instead of having a similar qualitative test set up for the second GUI iteration).

The demographics of the test participants should be described in more details, as this will shed light on the user group that was examined. For the test, more details about the test user’s education and computer literacy were requested but not described in the paper.

Finally, as the usability studies involved watching live videos from screens and saving them for later review, it would be good to mention in the paper how ethical review routines were followed and how informed consent by the test participants was obtained.

                         ===== Paper summary =====

This paper studies Tor’s configuration usability for censorship circumvention. A pluralistic walkthrough of the Tor interface by the authors and a small scale qualitative study were first used to identify struggles users may have with the current configuration interface. Feedback from this small study was used to make changes to the interface. The new interface was then tested and evaluated by a quantitatively oriented experiment with over 100 users.

                      ===== Comments for author =====

Although Tor has been studied a lot from technical and theoretical perspectives, few researchers have paid attention to associated usability issues, which should indeed be considered as important factors affecting the adoption of Tor. The current paper evaluates usability issues of Tor, especially from the perspective of censorship circumvention. It not only contributes to the limited amount of literature regarding Tor usability, but also offers practical design suggestions to improve the user experience of Tor. As such, the study is helpful, and I am glad that the authors are collaborating with the Tor development team (as they discuss towards the end of the paper).

Nevertheless, the discussion of related work needs to be improved. On the one hand, the discussion of the closely related work is very short and uninformative. What did we already learn from the few papers on Tor usability? What did we learn from the Tor GUI competition which took place in the past? On the other hand, the authors’ work is certainly not the first study to improve configuration interfaces for (security) software. I believe the scope of the related work is too narrow, and lessons learned from other work on usable security should be considered. In addition, it would be useful to also relate the paper to any literature on the usability of other circumvention tools/approaches.

The authors stress very heavily that their work is the first study that focuses on Tor as a circumvention tool. Can you elaborate how previous work failed to address this aspect? It seems to me that connecting to the Tor network is an important prerequisite for all uses of Tor.

Likewise, the abstract and introduction should make it clearer that the focus of the paper is on the redesign of the Tor connection configuration interface, and does not concern other aspects of the usage/usability/user perspective of the Tor system.

The section on Tor background could still be improved. For example, several mistakes by users in study 1 and 2 relate to the obfs3 option, which is however insufficiently explained.

I think conducting the small-scale qualitative study and pluralist walkthrough are appropriate and highly useful steps towards a redesign of the configuration interface. However, we do not learn much about the pluralistic walkthrough and heuristic evaluation. Can you elaborate what you learned from these and how these approaches contributed to your work? Further, it would be helpful to include in the results for study 1 how many users were affected by the different problems. You do that for one problem related to proxies, but not for the others.

In both user studies, a simulated censorship environment was applied to represent the real world scenarios. But details are missing such as how these scenarios accurately represent real world situations. I would like the author to offer more discussion on this issue. In addition, one thing I am curious about is why not taking advantages of real world censorship mechanisms instead of implementing a simulated environment?

Quite problematic from my point of view is the lack of a clearly articulated set of design principles and how these map into the proposed design changes. [The stated evaluation criteria are useful, but that is a different aspect. Of course, these criteria could be based on design principles.] What we have is a set of design alterations that map more or less to the stated problems, but it is unclear whether the made changes rely on a careful weighing of alternatives or perhaps some unstated design principles. This is exacerbated by the (previously mentioned) unclear discussion of the scope of the paper which further muddles what design choices may be available.

For example, an important issue which is repeatedly mentioned in the paper is the choice between automatic and manual configuration. I understand that this is a difficult issue, but it is really at the heart of a careful redesign of the configuration dialogue. At the moment, the proposed design takes some (perhaps half-hearted) steps towards automatization, but the available design space is much larger as the authors discuss in Section 8. In addition, the discussion around the appropriate choice is not rigorous enough. I am also wondering what led to the previous design choices in the configuration interface. As the authors are in contact with the developers they perhaps have some insights regarding that original design. I have a hard time believing that the Tor developers have not thought about the appropriate trade-off regarding the appropriate involvement of the user as the GUI competition of 2005 evidences. However, as the authors demonstrate there is certainly room for !
 improveme
 nt when one considers non-expert users.

Returning to the topic of design principles, one could argue that reducing the chance that users mistakenly reveal themselves to censors by trying to initiate contact to the Tor project (when it is blocked) would be one such important objective/principle. Multiple technical (internal and external measurements to identify location) and non-technical approaches (e.g., asking the user about his location) could be taken to guide the user towards the appropriate configuration choice which minimizes the risk of revealing themselves as Tor users. The design choice between them could be subject of a meaningful discussion. However, the discussion of such high-level issues which are central to censorship circumvention and the avoidance of potential harm resulting from engaging in censorship circumvention are missing. [Here a discussion of the scope of the work could help. For example, the authors could state that they limit themselves to incremental redesigns that do not change the hi!
 gh-level
 approach to such bigger trade-offs.]

In different security and privacy contexts a variety of design principles have been proposed. For example, researchers at Microsoft developed NEAT and SPRUCE to guide the development and deployment of security warnings. The Fair Information Practice Principles relate to appropriate privacy notice and consent. Those do not map exactly to this context, but perhaps they can be an inspiration for design principles for censorship circumvention.

The authors should make more space to present the changes in the configuration dialogue. For example, I would rather remove Figures 11 – 17 and replace them with screenshots of the old dialogue and the new dialogue. You partially do that with Figure 4 and 5, but it is not comprehensive, and the pictures are overlapping.

You may want to add a few sentences about the process of integration of the changes in the Tor Launcher. Was that a trivial process? What is the hurdle for other usability researchers to make changes to the configuration dialogue?

The quality of the writing of the paper is acceptable, but more careful proof-reading would have likely helped to avoid a lot of the existing grammar issues and typos. But except for one or two sentences the paper was understandable.

It seems the authors tried to anonymize the paper but failed to remove the reference about the xLab at UC Berkeley where they likely executed study 2.

The paper is not terribly well organized, and this is especially true when it comes to graphs and tables. Many times during my reading of the paper, I found it hard to link tables or graphs to the relevant texts. For example, Figures 4, 5, 6 do not seem to be referred in the text. Figures 11 and 12 are not mentioned in the relevant text, which is Appendix J.  A roadmap at the end of the introduction is missing.

                         ===== Paper summary =====

The goal of this research is to evaluate the usability of Tor within the context of censorship circumvention. To accomplish this goal the authors conducted two studies. In both studies, the researchers simulated various levels of censorship environments and asked participants to user Tor to circumvent the simulated censorship regime. Results indicate that interface changes may reduce the amount of time users spend configuring Tor for censorship circumvention.

                      ===== Comments for author =====

Overall, I am supportive of eventual publication of this work. It’s a clever way to study censorship circumvention in the lab, and addresses a very important topic. However, some rewriting to improve accuracy and clarity are required prior to publication.
My primary concerns are that the authors draw causal conclusions from the qualitative study and that the writing is unclear throughout. I believe both of these issues can be addressed in a revision.

Specifically, I recommend:

Related Work
The discussion of Tor throughout should be bolstered with published work. For example, section 3.2 discusses how internet censors try to block resources and Tor, but does not cite any references for these statements. Similarly, when discussing bridges and pluggable transports, please cite original work on Tor bridges and pluggable transports.

Also, there is a general lack of putting the results of this work in context with broader work in usable security. For example, the authors found that users tried the easiest path first. Is this common in usable security work? In HCI generally? Please put this work in context.

Causality

Please do not draw causal conclusions based on qualitative research. As such, please rephrase, “From interviewing our participants, we found that these challenges are the result of these underlying causes:”

Also, in the following you call the study a “qualitative experiment”. Is this what you mean? If so, please elaborate. Also rephrase to soften the causality. “The challenges users faced in the qualitative experiment and the respective underlying causes are used as feedback for redesigning the configuration interface.”

Clarity

In quite a few places the writing is unclear:

Page 1 - I’m not sure what you mean here. Please clarify – “All Tor users benefit from improving the configuration interface, and thereby increasing the adoption of Tor as a censorship circumvention tool.”

Page 2, 3.1 – What is the object of the study? It’s not immediately clear from the preceding sentence.

“Tor Launcher’s graphical user interface gives access to sophisticated circumvention mechanisms, giving the user the option to configure a proxy and bridge before connecting to Tor for the first time. This is the object of our study.”

3.3 – missing an “is”? “The minimum amount of configuration required, therefore, the set of valid configuration settings, vary depending on the censorship environment.”

Labels – NEW and OLD are confusing. OLD is actually current, so this label is particularly confusing.

I assume the protocol was IRB approved. Please add a statement to this effect so that it’s clear to all readers.

8.4.2 – since you don’t have any data about how long people will be willing to spend on configuring Tor, please be more careful in how you discuss it. Use qualifiers such as “may” and “we assume”. I could argue that people who really want to get to some information may be very highly motivated and therefore willing to spend hours configuring Tor. Without data, we don’t know who’s right, so be careful how you phrase things.

8.5.3 –leaked that they are leaking?  “Automate configuration after failure. After one unsuccessful attempt, a user has already leaked to network eavesdroppers leaking that they”

11 – “series of experiments” no… two studies, yes.

Questions and substantial changes

3.1 – “the interface eschews automatic configuration through network probing in favor of guided manual configuration to give users agency”

Do you know the goal of the manual configuration was to give users agency? Could it be user education? Could it be that designers never considered alternatives?

4 – You mention a heuristic evaluation. Where’s the data for the HE?

6.2 – What were these practices? “Using established practices from the field of user experience research”

6.3 – why did you think CNN and Wikipedia would be familiar to web users?

6.3 – do you mean they “took” an average of 45 minutes, or did you stop them at an average of 45 minutes? (“Participants had an average of 45 minutes to complete their worksheet.”

6.3 – wait, you had hypotheses? I thought you said this was a qualitative study to generate hypotheses? (“This was to verify any hypotheses we had (e.g. “they did not know what an ISP was”).”

6.4 – why are the quotes in the paper “not necessarily verbatim”? It would be easy enough to verbatim transcribe the quotes for publication.

8.4.1 – why would you not include the statistical test and p-value within the paper itself? Furthermore, why do you claim that sample size is the reason you saw no statistical differences? If the issue is really small sample size, then shouldn’t you run more participants? Did you do an a priori power analysis to determine optimum sample size?

8.5.2 – I appreciate the hedging that these results may not apply to all Tor users; that’s certainly true. But could you please provide more guidance about what may apply, what may not apply and why?

Results throughout – how do these results compare to other results in usable security? How are they the same? Different?


Easy fixes

Rephrase - “Our experiments are both a case study observing users circumvent censorship and a step toward helping current Tor users by making censorship circumvention easier.”

First page, list of contributions – consider starting sentences with numbers written out (e.g., 6 -> six)

Perhaps add an “eventually” to “We hope that our work helps users circumvent censorship and connect to Tor.” There are quite a few steps between this work and that goal…

In Figure 2, please remove, cite evidence for, or add a qualifier (e.g., may) for the statement, “users are not familiar with…)

6.2 (and throughout the rest of the manuscript) – generally suggest using numbers written out under ten, and always at the begging of a sentence (e.g., “4had used Tor before; 5 had heard of Tor but not used it; and the remaining 8 had never heard nor used it.”)

6.3 – The tense is all scrambled here. Please use either present or past (APA recommends past tense).

6.4 – have -> has and remain -> remains in “If progress bar reaches a 90% and fails, the next attempt have regressed to 0% and remain there until the progress surpasses 90%.”

7 – Tense again. Please be consistent with the tense. Consider past (e.g., we made ten changes).

7 – “This are two fewer screens in the revised interface.” Do you mean “there are two fewer”?

8.3 – are -> were in “A researcher informed the participants that they are in a simulated censorship environment,”
