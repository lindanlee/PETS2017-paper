We would like to thank the reviewers for their constructive comments. Looking back on the previous version of the paper, we are quite glad that we got a chance to resubmit the paper with some major changes. We believe that our paper was much better for it. 

Main changes: 
- Added a methodology section to explain why we chose our evaluation methods
- Added an inspection section that shows the interface user paths and various end states
- Added a design section that specifies our design principles
- Added screenshots of the all screens of old and new interface 
- Added road map of the paper in the introduction section
- Revised related work section to cover usable security, usability, and user-centered design 
- Replaced the qualitative study section with a summary of participant observations
- Replaced the quantitative discussion section with a recommendations section
- Moved statistical tests from the appendix to the main paper

Other changes: 
* Heavy rewording throughout the paper
* Lessened the emphasis on censorship and focused on testing the GUI
* Removed leading tones/causalities in the paper 
* Moved related work to the end of the paper
* Removed less important details/distracting sections into appendixes

Thanks again! Especially to reviewer 7D, who gave us very through comments.
