Log of work so that Linda can tell Dave/Serge what had happened in the last week. 


10/6-10/13: 
- Nathan finishes CITI certification. 
- Nathan is added to the IRB protocol.
- Fixed up the exit survey. 
- Looked into Xlab scheduling and discussed experiment dates. 
- Continued to write the paper as experiment unfolds. 
* Explicit discussion of hypotheses being tested.
* Adding questions to the survey to collect data on hypotheses. 
* Changing the briefing to get rid of role-play and generalize the setting. 
* Discussion of a possible pre-survey (to measure learning during the dialogue, but this might affect participant behaviorsâ€¦)
