These are the scripts we used to create the special instrumented
releases of Tor Browser. On Debian, install the dependencies:
	sudo apt-get install p7zip-full nsis
Then type
	make
The output will be a file tor-ux.zip that contains two versions of Tor
Browser, Firefox, Chrome, and scripts needed to set up firewall rules
and start and stop screen recording.

One necessary file, s3-uploader.exe, is not included in the repository
because it contains Amazon S3 credentials. You will need to build your
own copy with your own credentials from
https://github.com/nmalkin/s3-uploader.
